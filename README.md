# Interface Example using VBA - Observer Design Pattern

## Purpose

This was an experiment to try and model the Observer design pattern architecture in VBA using Interfaces.

It's not the full implementation of the pattern as found in other languages, the idea was merely for the code to be a reference point to show how to use an Interface.

## Setup

1. Create a new workbook.
2. Import all of the classes, modules and interfaces in this repo into the workbook. If you choose to paste the code into classes you create, then you should remove any text in red that appears at the top of each file (this is boiler plate code generated when files are exported from the VBE).
4. Run the test macro called 'TestObserverPattern'. You should see the results outputted to the Immediate Window.
